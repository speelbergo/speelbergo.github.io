//Create a "windchill.js" file and add it to your "script" folder in the "lesson-6" folder.
// The "windchill.js" script should get the two input values of temperature and wind speed,
// check to make sure they meet the required values allowed to officially calculate the wind chill, 
//and then either calculate and display the windchill factor value or display "N/A" (not applicable) 
//if the input values did not meet the requirements.
